Back To Work – Chrome Extension Overview
=======================================

Back To Work is a small Chrome extension that helps you stay aligned with your “work self” instead of blocking websites outright. It adds **gentle friction** when you drift to non‑work sites during your planned work time, so you notice the drift and can choose to come back.

Key ideas
---------

- **Identity, not punishment**  
  The extension assumes you *want* to be the “professional you” during work hours. It nudges you back instead of shaming or hard‑blocking you.

- **Friction instead of bans**  
  When you spend too long on non‑work sites, the extension gradually makes those sites feel slightly annoying to use: grayscale, subtle visual effects, playful messages, and stronger friction if you stay.

- **Work vs. free time**  
  You define what counts as “work sites” and which hours are work time for each day. Outside those hours, the extension mostly gets out of your way.

- **Lightweight and private**  
  All data is stored locally in your browser. Time‑tracking resets weekly so the data never grows huge and you are not building a permanent log of your behavior.

What the user experiences
-------------------------

- A **toolbar popup** where you choose the day’s mood:
  - Work only
  - Normal day
  - Low focus
  - No work today
  - Automatic (follow your schedule)
- A small card showing:
  - Whether you are currently in **Work mode** or **Free mode**
  - How many minutes of **focused work** you have today
  - Which domains you defined as work sites
- On non‑work sites during work time:
  - At first, nothing happens.
  - After a while, a small toast appears: a short reminder that you are in work mode.
  - If you keep scrolling, the nudges become more noticeable: grayscale, fun / serious messages, and eventually stronger friction that makes it easier to leave than to stay.

Who this is for
---------------

- People who want **structure without strict blocking**
- Freelancers and remote workers who need a light “work container”
- Anyone who prefers **gentle, identity‑based nudges** instead of hard limits
