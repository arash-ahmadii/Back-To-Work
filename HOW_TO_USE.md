How to Use “Back To Work”
=========================

This guide explains how a non‑technical user can install and use the Back To Work Chrome extension.

1. Install the extension (developer mode)
----------------------------------------

Until this is published in the Chrome Web Store, you install it as an “unpacked” extension:

1. Download or clone the `Back To Work` folder to your computer.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Turn on **Developer mode** (top‑right toggle).
4. Click **“Load unpacked”**.
5. Select the `Back To Work` folder.

You should now see the Back To Work icon in your toolbar.

2. Set up your work schedule and sites
--------------------------------------

1. Click the Back To Work icon in the toolbar.
2. In the popup, click **“Settings”** (or the options link).
3. In the **Options** page:
   - **Work sites**:  
     Enter one domain per line (for example):  
     `github.com`  
     `notion.so`  
     `stackoverflow.com`
   - **Weekly schedule**:  
     For each day, choose whether it is a work day and set the start and end hours.
   - **Extension mood (humor)**:  
     Use the slider to choose how serious or playful the messages should be.
4. Click **Save**.  
   Your changes apply immediately to the active tab.

3. Choose your mode for today
-----------------------------

Open the popup again by clicking the extension icon. You will see five modes:

- **Work only** – Treat today as a full work day. Non‑work sites will get stronger friction faster.
- **Normal day** – Follow your schedule with moderate nudges on non‑work sites.
- **Low focus** – Softer, more forgiving reminders.
- **No work today** – Take the day off. Rules are relaxed, logging continues.
- **Automatic** – Let the extension decide based on your weekly schedule.

Click a mode; the active mode button will highlight immediately and the description below will update.

4. What happens on websites
---------------------------

When you are in **Work mode** and visit a site that is **not** in your work list:

1. **Grace period**  
   At first, nothing happens. You can take a quick look.

2. **Mild friction**  
   After spending some time, a small toast appears in the bottom‑left corner with a gentle reminder.

3. **Medium friction**  
   If you stay longer, the page becomes grayscale and messages continue to appear every 40 seconds.

4. **Strong friction**  
   If you keep going, the extension adds stronger effects:
   - Blurred images and videos
   - Hidden “suggested” sidebars
   - Slight movement or distortion
   - Eventually, clicks and scrolling become harder, nudging you to leave

You can always ignore the nudges, but the experience becomes less comfortable the longer you stay.

5. Check your focused work time
-------------------------------

In the popup, you can see:

- **“Professional You · Work mode”** or **“Free You · Free mode”**
- **Focused work today (minutes)** – counted when you are on work sites during work mode
- The list of work sites you configured

This helps you see, at a glance, how much real work time you have already logged today.
